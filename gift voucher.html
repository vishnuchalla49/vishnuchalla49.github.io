        <h1>Look At our Gift Voucher!!!</h1>

        <li>A gift card also known as gift certificate in maa cafe or gift voucher is a prepaid stored-value money card, usually issued by a retailer or bank, to be used as an alternative to cash for purchases within a particular store or related businesses. </li>

        <li>Gift cards are also given out by employers or organizations as rewards or gifts.</li>

        <li>They may also be distributed by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called cash cards. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. American Express, MasterCard, and Visa offer generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for cashback marketing strategies. </li>

        <li>A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.</li>

        <li>From the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a gift, given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. </li>

        <li>MaaCafe.com sells gift certificates to our customers at deep discounts. Their normal price is Rs101 for a rs25 gift certificate, but they often run promotions where you can buy the same Rs25 gift certificate for just Rs2 or Rs3.</li>

        <li>A gift card may resemble a credit card or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.</li>
