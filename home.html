    <p>South Indian cuisine usually encompasses the five Southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Telangana, and Kerala. Both the geography and cultural influence of the South has an influence on the region's cuisine. As with most countries, there are large regional differences and each state's cuisine can vary greatly even within a specific state. There are typically vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for all five states. Additionally, all regions have typical main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, and drinks that are well-known in their respective region.


        South India has a hot, humid climate and all its states are coastal. Rainfall is abundant and so is the supply of fresh fruit, vegetables, and rice. Andhra Pradesh produces fiery Andhra cuisine which is largely vegetarian yet has a huge range of seafood in its coastal areas. Tamilnadu has Chettinad cuisine, perhaps the fieriest of all Indian food. This style too is largely vegetarian.
        
        
        From Kerala comes Malabari cooking, with its repertoire of tasty seafood dishes. Hyderabad is the home of the Nizams (rulers of Hyderabad) and regal Nizami food rich and flavorful with tastes ranging from spicy to sour to sweet. Hyderabadi food is full of nuts, dried fruits, and expensive spices like saffron.
        
        Style of Food
        By and large, South Indian cuisine is perhaps the hottest of all Indian food. Meals are centered around rice or rice-based dishes. Rice is combined with Sambaar (a soup-like lentil dish tempered with whole spices and chilies) and rasam (a hot-sour soup-like lentil dish), dry and curried vegetables, meat dishes, and a host of coconut-based chutneys and poppadums (deep-fried crispy lentil pancakes). South Indians are great lovers of coffee, which is usually a special type made with chicory.
        
        Staple Foods
        No South Indian meal is complete without rice in some form or other. It's either boiled rice or Idlis (steamed cakes made from rice batter), dosas, or uttapams (pancakes made from a batter of rice and lentil flour). Daals (lentils) are also a part of most meals.
        
        Common Cooking Oils
        Because it is easily available, coconut oil is most commonly used for cooking and frying. Vegetable oils like sunflower and canola are also used and ghee is poured over rice during daily meals or onto special occasion dishes.The similarities[citation needed] among the five states' cuisines include the presence of rice as a staple food, the use of lentils and spices, dried red chilies and fresh green chilies, coconut, and native fruits and vegetables including tamarind, plantain, snake gourd, garlic, and ginger. The four cuisines have much[citation needed] in common and differ primarily[citation needed] in the spiciness of the food.From Kerala comes Malabari cooking, with its repertoire of tasty seafood dishes. Hyderabad is the home of the Nizams (rulers of Hyderabad) and regal Nizami food rich and flavorful with tastes ranging from spicy to sour to sweet. Hyderabadi food is full of nuts, dried fruits and exotic, expensive spices like saffron.

        Kerala, Tamil Nadu, south and coastal Karnataka and most parts of Andhra Pradesh use more rice[citation needed]. People also consume ragi, or finger millet, in large quantities in southern Karnataka. North Karnataka, on the other hand, consumes more bajra (pearl millet) and sorghum[citation needed], while the Telangana state uses more jowar and pearl millet.[citation needed] Consumption of rice is more common among certain Brahmin communities.The cuisines of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are the spiciest in all of India. Generous use of chili and tamarind make the dishes tangy and hot. The majority of dishes are vegetable- or lentil-based. The hot and spicy dishes are a speciality of the region. Mainly vegetarian dishes are served as part of the cuisine of the region. The uniqueness of Telugu cuisine is that it is a blend of both Hindu as well as Muslim styles of cooking.

        Rice is the staple food of the region. Sambar is a special kind of dal prepared in Andhra Pradesh. A traditional Andhra meal comprises five kinds of dishes. To cool the stomach after a spicy meal, curd is served at the end.</p>
