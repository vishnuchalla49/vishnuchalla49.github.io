       Hope this helps!There are 2 types of catering provided by us:They areOn-premise catering refers to food prepared and served in the same location to a group of people. 
       Off-premise catering is food that is prepared in a kitchen and transported to the location where it will be served to a group of people.

       Both on-premise and off-premise catering have much in common. Obviously, transportation by vehicle is a main difference.
       It complicates food safety issues such as packing safely to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold, and to avoid spillage. 
       This is accomplished by using:
       
       insulated coolers,
       refrigerated vehicles, and
       portable warming units.
       A caterer’s reputation for high-quality food that is safely prepared can take years to develop. Any outbreak of a food borne illness could result in lawsuits, death, and the closing of the business. Safe food handling procedures are a must; there are no shortcuts.</p>
